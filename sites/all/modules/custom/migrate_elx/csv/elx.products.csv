No—it is not recommended and it is very important that you explain this to every customer. The brush was intended to be applied to dry skin only. Using the brush to apply the mask will cause the brush bristles to discolor. In addition, if the customer cleans the brush by submerging it in water repeatedly over time, it will damage the brush—similar to caring for any type of makeup brush. 

""What instructions should I give my customers about caring for the brush?""
Explain to the customer that the brush should be applied to dry skin only. Explain that the dry brush should be wiped with tissue after each use. Periodically she should cleanse the ends of the bristles with mild soap and water by gently swirling the tips in your palm. Next, swirl the brush again—this time in water only—to remove any remaining soap. Do not submerge the brush in water. Air dry brush on its side. Allow to fully dry before reusing. 

""How do I clean the counter for demonstration purposes?""
After each use, spray tissue with hygienic spray. Lay tissue flat on a hard surface. Use gentle pressure, moving the brush in circular motions, to ensure only the ends of the bristles touch the tissue. Air dry brush on its side in an open environment, and allow to fully dry before reusing.

""Why is it called Mask Noir?""
Mask Noir translates to “black mask” referring to the striking jet-black color of the mask. 

""What makes the mask jet black?""  
The Bamboo Charcoal contributes to the striking jet-black color of the mask. This natural charcoal is known for its purifying and detoxifying powers.

""What makes this mask different from other masks on the market?""
Re-Nutriv Ultimate Diamond Mask Noir is a luxurious, spa-like experience you can create at home. First, the exclusive, silky soft custom brush has a cashmere-like feel that creates an ultra pampering and invigorating experience for your skin. The brush, along with our custom massage technique, help increase skin’s microcirculation. 
Re-Nutriv Ultimate Diamond Mask Noir is infused with a concentrated level of our precious Black Diamond extract—to  help re-energize the look of skin. It is a multi-benefit formula that nourishes while helping to purify, detoxify and retexturize skin. With just one treatment, skin looks and feels transformed.                           

""What is special about the brush?""
This ultra-luxurious brush was carefully selected for its silky, cashmere-soft feel. The brush was also meticulously designed with an ultra-dense set of fibers for an extremely pampering and unique sensorial experience. 

This ritual was inspired by the ancient therapy of ""dry brushing"" which is adapted from a traditional “body” technique, now for the first time for face. 
This silky soft brush combined with the innovative massage helps increase microcirculation, re-energize skin's appearance and preps skin for the mask that follows.  

""Can I use the brush without the mask to increase micro-circulation?""
Yes, but for the optimal experience we recommend using the brush followed by the mask. 

""What nutrient and minerals are in the mask?""
The nutrient-rich blend is infused with key minerals such as Magnesium, Calcium, and Zinc.

""How do I use it?""
Use once a week following steps below:

Step 1: Dry brush on clean skin.
Use the brush dry, directly on clean skin*.

Chin and Cheek 
Using small circulating motions, massage from chin, along jaw, to bottom of ear—twice. Next, massage from sides of nose, across cheek to temple—twice. Repeat on other side of the face. 

Tip to Temple
Sweep brush from tip of nose to forehead, then use the small circular motion to massage above eyebrow, moving toward temple. Do this twice, and then repeat on other side of face. 

Up and Over
In one continuous motion, sweep brush from tip of nose up and over eyebrow, down side of face and neck to collarbone. Repeat on other side. Wipe brush with tissue.  

*Important: For best results, the brush should only be used dry, directly on your skin. Never apply the mask with the brush as the massage effect will be diminished and bristles will become discolored.

Step 2: Apply Mask Noir.
Next use the golden spatula to scoop desired amount of the mask out of the jar. Applying with your fingertips, smooth a thin layer over your skin. Wait 5 minutes, and then with warm water, gently massage with your fingertips, using a small circular motion and moving from the center of the face toward the outer edge. Avoid eye area. 

Rinse with warm water, then use a cotton ball to sweep on Re-Nutriv Softening Lotion or preferred toning or treatment lotion. Follow with the rest of your Re-Nutriv skincare ritual.
